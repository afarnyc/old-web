				<h3 class="center">Alicia Lockard-Lewis</h3>
				<article>
					Alicia Lockard-Lewis has always been taught to love, respect and care for animals. She grew up in a rural town where her grandfather worked at a bauxite mine that doubled as a dump for all the unwanted animals in the area. Alicia's house and small acreage was a makeshift animal sanctuary for numerous cats, kittens, and a dog&#8212;or two&#8212;along with her own resident cats, dogs and horses.  Her mom is actively involved in coordinating the feeding and care of the feral cat colonies in her area of Los Angeles in addition to caring for numerous special needs kitties of her own.  When people ask Alicia why shes loves animals so much, she just tells them it is genetic. 
					Alicia and her husband have six American Pit Bull Terriers, two retired Tonkinese show cats, a twelve year old Siamese cat (that they recently adopted because her owner moved to England), and a fourteen year old Irish Blue Cat that her husband literally rescued out of a dog’s mouth at two weeks old.  
					She works diligently in her community to place abandoned cats and dogs in new homes and tries to help any needy animal&#8212;domestic or wild&#8212;that crosses her path.  She has been in the print publishing industry for twenty-five years and is currently pursuing a Master’s degree in Organizational Communication.

				<h4 class="center"><a href="http://public-matter.com" class="link-regular" target="_blank">Founder, Public Matters</a></h4>
				<article>
					Jae Hee Lee had cultivated a love for animals ever since she was a child in California. She recounts that back home, it was normal to see animals&#8212;domestic or otherwise&#8212;run about the vast parks and open spaces available. Even the shelters that she encountered there, were spacious and well staffed. After moving to the East Coast, Jae Hee realized the limitations of space and how vital it was to the well being of animals. As a designer and architect, she believes in the ability to expand the ways in which spaces are built and used to accommodate not only human beings but the animals that inhabit the cities we live in. An awareness of the needs of animals is the first step in developing a safer and healthier living environment for metropolitan areas. Since earning her BArch at <a href="https://aap.cornell.edu/academics/architecture" class="link-regular" target="_blank">Cornell University</a>, she has worked for H Architecture and WXY Studios in New York City. Her work and interests can be seen <a href="http://cargocollective.com/jhl-works" class="link-regular" target="_blank">here</a> .
