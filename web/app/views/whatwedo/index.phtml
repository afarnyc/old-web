				Angels for Animal Rights (AFAR) is a registered 501(c)(3) non-profit organization that runs local pet aid programs and maintains online resources committed to educating the public about at risk animals, current policies, and what can be done to make a difference in animal lives. Our local projects serve the Greater New York area and focus on bringing comfort to shelter animals and providing support for pets of military veterans.

				Our mission is simple: increase awareness of animal issues, assist pets and owners with limited resources, and promote cruelty-free and sustainable living. Our motto states this best, <em>"working towards a cruelty-free and compassionate world."</em>

				Under our goals, the key advocacy fields are adoption and fostering&#8212;for good reason. According to the Humane Society of the United States, shelters take in around 6-8 million dogs and cats each year, of whom 3-4 million are euthanized for lack of space. We cannot let this continue to be the norm. We believe through our collective efforts we can push for change, resulting in more favorable legislation for animals both in the U.S. and abroad.

				By offering virtual volunteering opportunities and using social media as a tool, we are expanding our efforts daily in saving at risk animals and preventing such conditions, in the first place. Animal loving professionals in many fields continue to contribute to our organization in order to bring information that is relevant, helpful, encouraging and engaging to affect change. We endeavor to be a reliable resource for people who want to help improve and encourage the humane treatment of animals everywhere.
