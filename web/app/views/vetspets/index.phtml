				Angels for Animal Rights believes that every pet serves as a form of therapy for its humans. This is especially true for our veterans, who rely on their pets for comfort and emotional support. The Vets’ Pets program is designed as a support system for veterans’ pets so they never have to worry about their best friend. AFAR helps with low-cost medical treatment, medicine, food and supplies, and training.

				AFAR also finds short term fosters for Veterans when needing treatment as well as taking case by case situations for deployment and/or re-homing. Contact us for more details and please consider making a donation towards this program.
